# Udagram Image Filtering Microservice

Udagram is a simple cloud application developed alongside the Udacity Cloud Engineering Nanodegree. It allows users to register and log into a web client, post photos to the feed, and process photos using an image filtering microservice.

My part of the project is:

-. [The Image Filtering Microservice]It is a Node-Express application which runs a simple script to process images.

Developing on dev branch and when running ok to master branch.


## Tasks done:

### Setup Node Environment

Created a new node server.

1. Initialize a new project: `npm i`
2. run the development server with `npm run dev`

### Created a new endpoint in the server.ts file

-Completed an endpoint in `./src/server.ts` which validates the query parameter if any, and
downloads a filtered image from a public URL and a 200 HTTP code. 
If there is no parameter, it returns a 422 HTTP code, or if the image is not found it returns HTTP 404.

-Fixed helper function at util/util.js, because it was throwing an Unhandled Promise Rejection error on deploying.

### Deploying the system

Followed the process described in the course to `eb init` a new application and `eb create` a new environment to deploy the project. 
I had to change the .elascticbeanstalk/config.yml because it gave me errors while creating the environmen:
- Application Version does not exist locally
-This branch does not have a default environment.
